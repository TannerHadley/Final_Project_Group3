Courses routing for group project for group 3 -- 6 files

course_app = main routing
models/course.js = mangoDB database for courses
public/indiana.css = basic style sheet for pages
views/course_create.ejs = form for creating new courses
views/course_details.ejs = handles single course details and browser script for deleting single records
views/course_index.ejs = shows list of all courses


These files worked to add, delete, display all, and display single by ID in my VS node crash course tutorial environment. How to make these work in our environment?
